these are the notes for c language




i have studied till now how to start the code with #include in this i have learned about
#include <stdio.h> and <stdbool.h>

next up i have learned about variables:
1 int(we use %d)
2 float(we use %f)
3 bool(we use %d)
4 char(with and without a array)(%c and %s)
5 double(%lf)
