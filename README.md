# C Repository

Welcome to my C programming repository! 👨‍💻

This repository contains basic C programs that I’ve written as part of my learning journey. Each `.c` file contains a simple program, and corresponding `.exe` files are the compiled versions.

## 📁 Files Included

- `main.c`, `main.exe`: A basic C program.
- `new.c`, `new.exe`: Another simple C practice file.
- `practice.c`, `practice.exe`: Additional practice code.
- `variable.c`, `variable.exe`: Program demonstrating variable usage.

## 🛠️ How to Use

To run the C programs:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paritoshcode/c-repository.git
gcc filename.c -o filename.exe


Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
./filename.exe
